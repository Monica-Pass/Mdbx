# MDBX Storage And Sync Specification

Version: `MDBX-1-DRAFT`

This document defines the single-file container strategy, internal persistence rules, incremental update behavior, sync model, and attachment storage behavior.

## 1. Container Strategy

MDBX SHOULD use a single portable `.mdbx` file as the user-visible vault artifact.

Inside the `.mdbx` file, the preferred engine is:

- `SQLite + custom encryption layer`

`LMDB` MAY be explored later, but SQLite is the preferred baseline because of tooling maturity, portability, recovery tooling, and schema evolution support.

### Vault Creation Lifecycle

Vault creation MUST atomically reserve a path that does not exist. An existing regular file, SQLite database, MDBX vault, or same-name SQLite WAL/SHM sidecar MUST be rejected without changing its contents. A client-side existence check may improve the error message, but the storage reservation remains authoritative.

Creation remains pending until schema creation, vault metadata, the genesis commit, the initial branch, the device head, the initial key epoch, and the first unlock method have all succeeded. Failure before that point MUST close the SQLite connection and remove the main database plus any WAL and SHM sidecars created by the same attempt. Opening or upgrading an established vault uses the open and migration interfaces, never the create interface.

### Existing Vault Open Lifecycle

Open and explicit upgrade MUST first inspect the file through a read-only SQLite handle. The preflight must confirm an initialized `vault_meta` row, a supported MDBX format generation, and the absence of unknown critical extensions before any writable handle, WAL mode change, migration, or compatibility cleanup is allowed.

The writable handle MUST use read-write flags without SQLite create permission. A missing path or an uninitialized SQLite database is an error and must remain unchanged. Connection-only settings such as foreign-key enforcement and busy timeout may be applied before migration; persistent WAL and secure-delete settings plus legacy plaintext-index cleanup are applied only after identity validation and a successful transactional migration.

### Portable Backup Lifecycle

A portable backup is a transactionally consistent, self-contained `.mdbx` file produced from a live vault. The storage layer MUST use SQLite's online backup API or an equivalent database snapshot mechanism so committed pages still present only in the source WAL are included. Copying the source main file while WAL is active is not a complete backup operation.

The backup MUST be built in a temporary file in the destination directory, converted to a non-WAL journal mode, checked with SQLite integrity verification, and inspected as a current initialized MDBX vault. The copied `vault_id` MUST equal the source identity. The temporary file MUST be synchronized before publication, and publication MUST use no-clobber semantics.

The destination main file and its same-name `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars MUST all be absent. Any existing destination artifact is preserved and causes the operation to fail. A successful portable backup has no required sidecars and can be opened independently with the source vault's existing unlock methods.

The storage facade is authoritative for these guarantees. Rust clients use `BackupService::create_portable_copy`, UniFFI clients use `MdbxVault.create_backup`, and the reference CLI uses `mdbx backup <output>`.

## 2. Internal Storage Goals

The internal layout MUST support all of the following:

- append-friendly writes
- partial updates
- crash recovery
- attachment metadata storage
- attachment binary storage indirection
- version history
- conflict detection metadata
- future migration hooks

## 3. Minimum Internal Logical Tables

The minimum logical schema MUST reserve space for at least these record classes:

- `projects`
- `entries`
- `attachments`
- `attachment_chunks`
- `commits`
- `commit_parents`
- `device_heads`
- `branches`
- `tombstones`
- `snapshots`
- `key_epochs`
- `conflicts`
- `unlock_methods`
- `object_versions`
- `project_tags`

An MVP MAY omit some secondary indexes or optional tables, but MUST NOT omit `projects` or `attachments`.

## 4. Project-Oriented Schema Rules

The `projects` table is mandatory.
The `entries` table MUST reference `project_id`.

This means:

- every password-like secret belongs to a project
- queries MUST be able to fetch a project and then its child entries
- sync and merge logic MUST preserve project membership

## 5. Attachment Schema Rules

The `attachments` table is mandatory from version 1.
The `attachment_chunks` table SHOULD be present from version 1 even if chunked storage is only partially used in MVP.

The schema MUST support:

- attachment owned by project
- attachment optionally owned by a specific entry
- content hash
- chunked binary data or external content reference
- soft delete via tombstone or delete marker
- integrity verification

## 6. Write Path Requirements

Routine small edits MUST avoid full logical rewrite of the entire vault contents.

A compliant write path SHOULD:

1. update changed project or entry rows only
2. append a commit or oplog record
3. update lightweight head metadata
4. avoid touching unrelated attachment rows
5. avoid touching unrelated large binary pages

## 7. WAL And Append Strategy

The preferred implementation SHOULD use SQLite WAL mode or an equivalent append-friendly strategy.

Design goals:

- small edits generate small write deltas
- cloud sync tools can propagate small changed regions where supported
- periodic compaction is explicit and infrequent

The implementation MUST document how it preserves durability during power loss or crash.

## 8. Commit And History Model

MDBX MUST maintain a Git-like logical history.

Minimum requirements:

- each local mutation produces a commit-like history record
- commits reference one or more parent commits
- device-local order is monotonic
- concurrent histories remain representable until merged

A commit record SHOULD include:

- commit ID
- device ID
- local sequence number
- parent commit IDs
- changed object references
- timestamp
- optional merge metadata
- integrity data

## 9. Conflict Detection

MDBX MUST detect concurrent edits using causal metadata, not timestamp alone.

Minimum acceptable mechanisms:

- version vectors
- device sequence graph
- per-record revision lineage
- field-level conflict markers where necessary

Different-field concurrent changes within the same project MAY auto-merge when safe.
Same-field concurrent secret changes MUST create an explicit conflict.

## 10. Merge Model

MDBX SHOULD support:

- fast-forward merge
- three-way merge for non-secret text fields
- conflict record creation for unsafe merges
- user-visible merge resolution later

The merge system MUST preserve both sides when automatic resolution is unsafe.

## 11. Snapshot And Recovery

MDBX MUST support recovery from logical corruption or interrupted sync.

Minimum requirements:

- historical commits remain replayable
- snapshots can be produced periodically
- snapshots can rebuild projects, entries, attachment metadata, and embedded attachment chunks when present
- partially damaged vaults SHOULD still allow partial recovery

A snapshot is a logical recovery point stored inside a vault. It is distinct from a portable backup, which creates an independently openable complete vault file, and from a sync bundle, which carries incremental commit state between replicas. None of these artifacts can be replaced by copying only the SQLite main file while WAL is active.

## 12. Attachment Storage Modes

MDBX MUST define these storage modes even if not all are enabled in MVP:

- `embedded-inline`
  - small binary stored directly in attachment payload

- `embedded-chunked`
  - attachment stored in encrypted chunks inside the database

- `external-hash-ref`
  - database stores metadata plus verified external blob reference

Default recommendation:

- small attachments MAY be embedded
- large attachments SHOULD be chunked or externally referenced by content hash

## 13. Attachment Update Rules

Editing project metadata MUST NOT require rewriting large attachment content.
Editing entry fields MUST NOT require rewriting unrelated attachment content.
Renaming an attachment MUST update metadata only.

## 14. Cloud-Drive Optimization

MDBX is designed for sync through tools such as Syncthing, Git, Nextcloud, WebDAV-backed sync layers, Dropbox, and OneDrive.

The implementation SHOULD:

- minimize rewritten regions for small edits
- prefer append-heavy patterns over random rewrite where practical
- compact only when thresholds are met
- keep attachment bodies isolated from routine metadata edits

## 15. Performance Targets

Target goals for a healthy implementation:

- common metadata save under `100 ms`
- project open fast enough for interactive UI
- search clearly faster than large KDBX libraries
- cloud-drive delta for small edit remains in `KB` scale in normal cases

These are product goals and must be tracked with benchmarks.

## 16. Required Indexing

The storage engine SHOULD maintain indexes for at least:

- project title
- project tag membership
- project group membership
- entry type by project
- recent modification time
- attachment ownership
- tombstone lookup
- commit lineage lookup

Full-text search MAY use temporary indexes for decrypted titles during an unlocked session. Persistent FTS tables MUST NOT store decrypted project titles or other secret-bearing text.

Temporary search indexes are not user-visible history and MUST NOT create commits. User-visible project tags are metadata, not temporary search state: tracked tag mutations SHOULD create a project-scoped commit, and sync state SHOULD carry the complete tag set for each project so tag deletion, including deleting the final tag, can be replayed safely. Readers that receive an older sync payload without a tag field MUST preserve local tags instead of treating the missing field as an empty set.

## 17. Compaction Rules

Compaction MAY rewrite larger portions of the vault, but it MUST be:

- explicit or policy-driven
- recoverable if interrupted
- unnecessary for routine edits
- safe for attachment integrity

## 18. Minimum Export Requirements

The storage layer MUST support export paths for:

- full vault export
- project export
- attachment extraction with integrity check
- KDBX export bridge

## 19. Rejection Rules

A storage design is non-compliant if it:

- lacks a first-class `projects` structure
- lacks first-class `attachments` structure
- rewrites the whole vault on ordinary small field edits by design
- cannot represent concurrent histories
- cannot explain recovery after interruption
